## Exercises: 

### Exercise 1 - [Imprimir ASCII](/Imprimir-ASCII)
Exercise to print the ASCII table in the console using C++. 

It is composed of an application class and an interator (actually it is only a *conceptual* iterator since it does not really iterate on anything). 

The ideia is just to practice some initial C++ object oriented concepts. 

## Exercise 2 - [Tourist Attraction Linked Lists](/Tourist-Attractions-List)
Exercise to create a linked list of touristic attractions. It also has function to manipulate the list, such as adding, deleting and searching. This is made with OO concepts. 

## Exercise 2 - [Generic Linked Lists](/Tourist-Attractions-List)
Exercise to create a linked list of a generic node with only one value. It also has function to manipulate the list, such as adding, deleting and searching. This is purely made in C, without any OO.
